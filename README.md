#### Want to know which of your friends are sick? The Raspberry Pi can help!

This is an ongoing project for my [Introduction to Programming](http://silshack.github.io/fall2013/announcement/2013/08/07/welcome-to-560.html) course at UNC-Chapel Hill. Feel free to add to or borrow any of the code you find in this repository, but it would be awesome if you mentioned the project in your code if you do borrow anything.
