# Getting Started - Using the program

Before you get started, make sure you have:

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Python](http://www.python.org/getit/)
* [Tweepy](https://github.com/joshthecoder/tweepy)
* A basic text editor
* A command-line interface

If you're not familiar with using the command-line, you may want to take a look at tutorials for using the command-line (also known as terminal or prompt) for your operating system.


## Step One: Clone the repository.

You can't really start using the program if you don't have the files :). Open up a terminal, and make sure you're in your directory of choice. Then, enter the following command:

```
git clone http://github.com/IAMATinyCoder/DoctorPi.git
```

## Step Two: Select your database.

The default use of this program is to help you learn which of your friends is sick, but it can easily be customized to serve other purposes. If you desire, you can use this project to discover weather patterns, among other things. Regardless of what you choose to use it for, just make sure you have a database selected.


## Step Three: Register your app with Twitter.

In order to run this application you will need to create a new Twitter application, which you can do [here.](https://dev.twitter.com/apps)

## Step Four: Input your twitter data.

After you have created your Twitter application, you will be able to find your consumer key and consumer secret on the Details tab of your application, which you will need in order to run the Doctor Pi application. The other thing you will need to run Doctor Pi are your access token and access token secret, which you can get on the same page by clicking on the "Create my access token."

## Step Five: Have fun!
